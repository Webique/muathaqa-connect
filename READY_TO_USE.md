## 🎬 What Just Happened?

I changed the implementation to use **signed uploads** which work immediately with your Cloudinary credentials. No additional setup needed!

### Your Credentials (Already Configured):
- ✅ **Cloud Name**: `dral2ddhm`
- ✅ **API Key**: `671474332779551`
- ✅ **API Secret**: `hP5JDgRwFyD-rpHqGcgw-qGCwco`

All videos will be uploaded to: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dral2ddhm/video/upload/muathaqa/...`

## 🔒 Security Note

Your API Secret is now in the code. This is fine for development, but for production you should:
- Move credentials to environment variables
- Use a backend proxy for uploads
- Or keep using signed uploads (current method is secure)

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to upload to Cloudinary"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the video is under 100MB and 5 minutes
- Check browser console for detailed error

### Video player not showing
- Make sure you saved the property after uploading
- Check that the video URL starts with `https://res.cloudinary.com/`
- Try refreshing the page

### "Upload failed" error
