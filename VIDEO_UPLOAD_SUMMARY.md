## 🚨 ONE STEP LEFT TO COMPLETE!

**You MUST create an Upload Preset in Cloudinary:**

### Quick Instructions:

1. Go to: https://cloudinary.com/console
2. Click Settings ⚙️ → Upload tab
3. Scroll to "Upload presets" → Click "Add upload preset"
4. Set these values:
   - **Preset name**: `muathaqa_uploads`
   - **Signing Mode**: **Unsigned** (CRITICAL!)
   - **Folder**: `muathaqa` (optional)
5. Click Save

**Without this step, video uploads will fail!**

📖 **Detailed instructions**: See `QUICK_CLOUDINARY_SETUP.md`

**Q: What happens to old videos when I update a property?**  
A: They remain in Cloudinary. You may want to manually delete them to save storage.

**Q: Can users download videos?**  
A: Yes, if they use browser dev tools. For DRM protection, you'd need Cloudinary's paid features.
